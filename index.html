                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="details">Picture this, you are walking to a major museum in the year 1989 and you see a jarring poster plastered to a bus that reads “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” under that is a statistic that reads less than 5% of the artists in the modern art section are women, yet 85% of the nudes are female. You aren't even at the museum yet; this poster is street art. Plastered in protest by an anonymous collective of feminist artists in gorilla masks called the Guerrilla Girls. They tackled a problem that had been going on for decades. Creating a battle cry against gender inequality in the art spear. Today, female artists have been redrawing the boundaries of what art can do. With unapologetic messaging, bold visuals and loud interventions, feminist artists are challenging the power structures and redefining what their role in art is. </p>

                <h2>Brief History & Legacy of Feminist Art</h2>
                <p class="details">The feminist in art movement started its traction around the late 1960s and 1970s. It emerged alongside second-wave feminism. With a demand of recognition, representation and equal footing in the art world. Judy Chicago is well described as a pioneer for this movement with icon pieces such as The Dinner Party Where she celebrated overlooked women in history. Not only did they criticize the system, but these activists also challenged it as loudly as they could. Building on the foundation that was created, artists like the Guerrilla girls, Mickalene Thomas, and Jenny Holzer expanded what art can look like as a feminist, and where it can exist.

                <h2>Unmasking Inequality in the Art World</h2>
                <p class="details">Frustrated with the lack of representation of women and artists of color the Guerrilla Girls emerged wearing their iconic gorilla masks to conceal their identities and shift the attention to their message. With their anonymity and sharp humor combined with hard-hitting messages they became a signature strategy for critiquing institutional bias. Their most iconic work, featured above, “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” (1989) asks the provocative question while giving damning data about representation. Using the same visuals the art world at the time loved, classical nudes and high-art aesthetics. Flipping the narrative to expose its hypocrisy. They did not stop at just museums. Calling out even Hollywood and political figures. They took space in public places where it could not be ignored, blurring the line between art and protest. Using data, design and satire to empower the marginalized voice and push for accountability. More than 30 years later their impact is still felt in the art world. Inspiring future generations.

                <h2>Reclaiming the Gaze and Redefining Beauty</h2>
                <p class="details">Some artists carried out the feminist rebellion though painting and photography. Mickalene Thomas is one such artist. Combining bold rhinestone-encrusted portraits of black women to directly challenge the male-dominated ideals of beauty that the art establishment long upheld. Thomas has echoed the style of the Guerrilla Girls in works such as Le déjeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires (2010). She reinterprets the famous painting by Édouard Manet by replacing the passive female nude with three clothed, self-assured black women. Flipping the visual script and using art history against itself. If the Guerilla Girls opened the doors of conforming systems of power in art; Thomas walks through with a voice of her own.

                <h2>Words as Weapons in Public Space</h2>
                <p class="details">Stepping back in time, Jenny Holzer took everything one step further by turning public space into the platform for feminist and political resistance. She is best known for her minimalist yet piercing use of language in her projects to push her message onto urban landscapes. Her work proves that art can be linguistic, subversive and hauntingly direct. As opposed to visuals in a traditional sense. Her most famous work, Truisms (1977-1979) is just one-line statements such as “Abuse of power comes as no surprise” and “Protect me from what I want.” Phrases that were slapped anonymously around New York in the same spirit as the Guerrilla Girls popularized just a few years later. Later she used LED signs, benches and even projected light to show phrases in public, forcing those passing by to be faced with uncomfortable truths. Her feminist activism doesn't scream, it simmers and invites people to question the system they are living within. Redefining what feminist art can be.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="details">From messages glowing brightly on the street, rhinestone studded portraits, or masked provocations. Feminist art has radically reshaped both the spaces where it operates and the art world itself. In work that doesn't just define terms of engagement it DEMANDS visibility. Pushing against the aesthetic norms and cultural silence. Women are reclaiming walls, public spaces and bodies with more than just the words or images they are creating. They are making movements. And I believe so long as inequality exists in this world, feminist art is going to be essential to making the future a more welcoming space.
